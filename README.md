  interact with other user by basic CRUD function
- Information is overloaded these days. Though, picking a right tool to update your information is a matter of life and death. To make you choose a right channel to get information, I decide to make this app which could make user to choose resources while preventing from obtaining biased information. Also, user could know what other user saved and read.
